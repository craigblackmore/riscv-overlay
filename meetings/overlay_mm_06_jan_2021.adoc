== General summary

* Overlay standard draft v2 is under PR will be promoted soon
* We started reviewing the HLD (high-level design)
** Starting from FW usage and FW RT Engine HLD
*** We stopped after covering the Multi-groups
** Next will cover the HLD of the toolchain


== Action items

* Promote the first HLD draft
* Merge the standard v2


== Open issue / Open discussion
* Still pending:
Inputs from Michael E. the current concept is based on the relative between the
"storage" and the "heap", can we think of a different approach of "altering"
symbols on runtime so they won't be relative to the heap ?

* The question related to how code that references absolute addresses could be
handled whilst avoiding having to rewrite addresses at runtime.

** Without seeing the use case, it is assumed that this relates to some code
 that jumps to or loads from an absolute address, but that absolute address
 is in an overlay.



== Next
* Continue with FW usage and FW RT Engine HLD
